#StepPage Design
The app listens for voice commands like “Next” or “Repeat” while the user cooks. The UI should be clean, distraction-free, and primarily voice-controlled, with minimal fallback controls.

🖥️ Layout & Behavior
• Fullscreen layout with centered content
• Large current step displayed prominently in the center
• Big font, highly legible, centered text
• Step progress indicator (e.g., “Step 2 of 7”) above or below the main text
• Voice listening indicator (e.g., a glowing microphone icon)
• Visibly shows when the app is actively listening
• Manual navigation buttons as fallback (optional, bottom of screen)
• “Previous step” / “Next step”
• Should not be distracting — shown only if voice fails or user taps

🧭 Controls
• Primary input is voice navigation
• App listens for commands like:
• “Next”
• “Previous”
• “Repeat”
• Microphone icon shows active state (e.g., pulsating or glowing)
• Optionally: small “mic off” icon or state if browser denies permission

🎨 Design Guidelines
• Minimalist and distraction-free UI
• Use brand colors (e.g., #E87C4B for accents, light background)
• Responsive design – works well on both mobile and tablet
• Prioritize accessibility (clear contrast, large touch targets)
